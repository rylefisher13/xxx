Of course. Here is the YouTube script as requested.

### **YouTube Script**

**(Intro Music - tense, investigative but subtle)**

**NARRATOR:**
Steven Bonnell, the streamer known as Destiny, is a man embattled. He’s currently fighting a federal lawsuit alleging he distributed intimate images without consent and is facing the specter of criminal charges for allegedly recording individuals without their knowledge. In the midst of this legal storm, a new drama has emerged, one that Destiny has seized upon with remarkable ferocity. It involves Jstlk, a creator who has been meticulously covering the allegations against him, and Chaeiry, one of Destiny’s primary accusers.

`destiny_reveals_dating.mp4`

**DESTINY (CLIP):** My life is humiliating and worthless. The person I've been in love with and spent every day with for the past year was divorcing my husband and ruining my life to be with just took my last reason to live.

**NARRATOR:**
The revelation: Jstlk and Chaeiry are in a relationship. For Destiny, this isn't just a personal matter between two people; it’s a narrative opportunity. A chance to reframe the entire situation, to cast doubt on his critics, and to paint himself not as a defendant, but as the victim of a grand, coordinated conspiracy.

`destiny_conflict_of_interest.mp4`

**DESTINY (CLIP):** The person who was making accusations about me and then was on justical stream as he's supposed to be supposedly the impartial person covering things... happened to be dating one of the people... I feel like that's um what do you say a conflict of interest a little bit or something maybe that is worth disclosing but who knows.

**NARRATOR:**
A conflict of interest. An interesting accusation of undisclosed relationships coming from Destiny. Let's recall his history. For months, Destiny feuded with a former partner, Anna. He publicly directed his audience to a Kiwi Farms thread dedicated to harassing her, a thread that contained her private information.

`Y91C-2onTSs_doxing_anna.mp4`

**DESTINY (FLASHBACK CLIP):** This is my only non-media blackout time... Somebody on Kiwi Farms has made a thread of Anna. So if you are obsessed with Anna and you want to talk about her all the time... you can actually go to Kiwi Farms and you can go and post all you want... Go there, post about it, talk about it.

**NARRATOR:**
What Destiny failed to disclose at the time was that he and Anna were secretly in an ongoing relationship.

`Y91C-2onTSs_anna_secret_relationship.mp4`

**INTERVIEWER (FLASHBACK CLIP):** So you acknowledge that you've been with her for a year?
**DESTINY (FLASHBACK CLIP):** I think yeah, we've had on and off, sure.

**NARRATOR:**
With the seed of a "conspiracy" planted, Destiny pivots to his next line of attack: painting Jstlk as a sinister manipulator who took advantage of a vulnerable Chaeiry.

`destiny_dr_k_manipulation.mp4`

**DESTINY (CLIP):** When Cherry said that Jessica would be her Dr. K, that looked like some insane manipulation to me.

**NARRATOR:**
Destiny insists that this type of manipulative behavior is alien to him. He claims his own toxic trait is simply being avoidant.

`destiny_im_not_a_manipulator.mp4`

**DESTINY (CLIP):** My biggest problem in relationships is actually very consistently that I just disconnect too much... I have a very dismissive, avoidant personality. Um, I'll just stop talking to the person.

**NARRATOR:**
He just "disconnects."

`(Series of rapid, jarring flashback clips)`

`Y91C-2onTSs_choke.mp4`
**DESTINY (FLASHBACK CLIP):** ...you better believe I had to choke her out a few times!

`Y91C-2onTSs_threaten_kill.mp4`
**DESTINY (FLASHBACK CLIP):** I do want somebody to kill Jstlk though.

`Y91C-2onTSs_assault.mp4`
**DESTINY (FLASHBACK CLIP):** ...I completely and totally like assaulted a girl on stream before...

**NARRATOR:**
The projection is breathtaking. Destiny accuses Jstlk of holding his community "hostage" by threatening to delete his content if the relationship was revealed.

`destiny_hostage_community.mp4`

**DESTINY (CLIP):** ...holding her only friend group, his community, hostage by telling her that if she ever went public with their relationship that he would delete all of it.

**NARRATOR:**
This, from the man who openly stated he wants a witness in his own legal saga killed.

`Y91C-2onTSs_threaten_kill.mp4`

**DESTINY (FLASHBACK CLIP):** I do want somebody to kill Jstlk though. Or Lav, or Mr... all those people can go die.

**NARRATOR:**
Central to Destiny's narrative is Chaeiry's mental health. He performs a delicate dance of feigned sympathy followed by immediate invalidation, using her diagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder as a tool to cast doubt on her credibility.

`destiny_unreliable_narrator.mp4`

**DESTINY (CLIP):** So Cherry obviously is an unreliable uh narrator. Unless she's making accusations against me, then she's the most reliable narrator.

**NARRATOR:**
He then establishes a clear double standard. When assessing Jstlk's alleged behavior, it’s chalked up to a simple mistake.

`destiny_dumb_selfish_decisions.mp4`

**DESTINY (CLIP):** Steven is overblowing what seems to be a dumb making selfish decisions and another dumb making stupid decisions... That's all just a oops. That was just um people were just making dumb selfish decisions. Oopsies.

**NARRATOR:**
But when his *own* alleged actions are scrutinized, it’s never an "oopsie." It’s a calculated, evil plot by his enemies to frame him.

`destiny_most_evil_ever.mp4`

**DESTINY (CLIP):** I like how if I ever do anything wrong ever, it's actually calculated from the time of birth to be the most evil and unhinged and terrible, horrible, evil, manipulative ever.

**NARRATOR:**
This pattern of misdirection and victimhood is a carbon copy of his behavior regarding his federal lawsuit. He has consistently misrepresented court proceedings, flip-flopped on his positions, and attacked the opposing counsel as incompetent and malicious, all while trying to frame routine legal procedure as a personal victory.

`nFF-vjs3P2s_legal_contradiction.mp4`

**(Flashback clip montage showing Destiny first saying sealing witnesses is wrong, then saying it's appropriate and expected when the judge rules against him.)**

**NARRATOR:**
So, what is the endgame of this theatrical performance? It's not about the drama. It’s about deflection. It's an aggressive PR campaign designed to muddy the waters around the very serious allegations he faces. In his own bizarre analogy, Destiny compared his critics to a virus.

`destiny_herpes_analogy.mp4`

**DESTINY (CLIP):** I think that Kiwi Farms and Justicle are kind of like that reservoir of weird like conspiratorial stuff. And what'll happen is anytime you get into a fight with somebody... they find a way to kind of like flare up, they will eject all of their unhinged into some public form.

**NARRATOR:**
Destiny wants you to believe this is just another "flare up" from his unhinged critics. But the fight he's in isn't with a commentary channel; it's with multiple accusers and the federal court system. This stream isn't about truth. It's about narrative warfare. An attempt to poison the well, to re-brand his accusers as obsessed, manipulated conspirators. It is the desperate act of a man trying to rewrite his own story before a judge and jury have the final say.

**(Outro Music - fades in)**

    *   **Segment B (Agreeing with the motion):** `nFF-vjs3P2s.mp4` | 02:15 - 02:20 ("There's nothing wrong with them filing stuff under seal... I think it's appropriate.")
