### **YouTube Script: The Herpes Defense**

**(NARRATOR)**
In the online world, narratives are weapons. And for prolific streamer Destiny, currently facing a federal lawsuit for the alleged distribution of intimate images without consent, a new weapon just fell into his lap.

**(NARRATOR)**
The news broke that jstlk, a commentator who has extensively covered Destiny’s legal troubles, was dating Chaeiry, one of Destiny’s accusers and a key figure in the case. For most, this is messy personal drama. For Destiny, it was an opportunity.

`D_ConflictOfInterest.mp4`
**(DESTINY CLIP)**
The person who was making accusations about me and then was on justical stream as he's supposed to be supposedly the impartial person covering things... happened to be dating one of the people who was in the process of leaving her husband for him. I feel like that's um what do you say a conflict of interest a little bit or something maybe that is worth disclosing but who knows.

**(NARRATOR)**
A conflict of interest. A lack of disclosure. These are serious-sounding accusations. And Destiny spends a great deal of time painting jstlk as a secret manipulator.

`D_DrK_Manipulation.mp4`
**(DESTINY CLIP)**
When Cherry said that Jessica would be her Dr. K, that looked like some insane manipulation to me.

**(NARRATOR)**
Insane manipulation. A strong charge from a man who insists he simply doesn’t engage in that kind of behavior.

`D_NoCrazyManipulator.mp4`
**(DESTINY CLIP)**
But I don't really do this type of like the crazy manipulator stuff. Uh, if anything, like if you ask anybody... my biggest problem in relationships is actually very consistently that I just disconnect too much. The idea that I would have the time to like go through and do the crazy manipulator game... I just don't have the interest for it.

**(NARRATOR)**
He doesn't have the interest. He just disconnects. Let’s look at a time he "disconnected" from his then-partner, Anna, after his fans, at his direction, found and created a doxxing thread about her.

`D_DirectsFansToDoxAnna.mp4`
**(DESTINY CLIP - from Y91C-2onTSs.mp4)**
Somebody on Kiwi Farms has made a thread of Anna. So if you are obsessed with Anna and you want to talk about her all the time... you can actually go to Kiwi Farms and you can go and post all you want.

**(NARRATOR)**
When she confronted him, terrified that he had just put her in danger, this was his "disconnected" response.

`D_AnnasTextAndResponse.mp4`
**(DESTINY'S RESPONSE - from Y91C-2onTSs.mp4)**
You're doing it to yourself and you're going to keep doing it to yourself.

**(NARRATOR)**
Destiny portrays jstlk as a predator, leveraging Chaeiry’s vulnerability for his own gain, isolating her from support systems while holding her only remaining community hostage.

`D_IsolatingHer.mp4`
**(DESTINY CLIP)**
She says she has no community, okay, isolated from every community except for Just as he literally tells her that he will be her Dr. K so that she can continue to go on his stream and amplify attacks of me.

`D_HoldingHostage.mp4`
**(DESTINY CLIP)**
...and at the same time holding her only friend group, his community, hostage by telling her that if she ever went public with their relationship that he would delete all of it.

**(NARRATOR)**
The accusations are textbook emotional abuse. The problem for Destiny is, he’s not just describing abuse, he’s describing his own playbook. He doesn't have time for manipulation, unless it's threatening to kill the people who criticize him.

`D_KillThreats.mp4`
**(DESTINY CLIP - from Y91C-2onTSs.mp4)**
I do want somebody to kill jstlk though, or lav or... all those people can go die.

**(NARRATOR)**
This isn't a new strategy. It's a pattern of deflection. When his back is against the wall, he attacks the credibility of others, misrepresents the facts, and hopes his audience doesn't notice the contradictions. Take his ongoing court case. For weeks, he insisted that the plaintiff's attorneys were acting improperly by trying to file witness declarations under seal.

`D_CantFileUnderSeal.mp4`
**(DESTINY CLIP - from nFF-vjs3P2s.mp4)**
You you can't file stuff under seal and keep it from the defense. You just can't do that. I don't know why they keep trying to make this argument that they can.

**(NARRATOR)**
He hoped for sanctions against them for even trying.

`D_HopesForSanctions.mp4`
**(DESTINY CLIP - from nFF-vjs3P2s.mp4)**
I hope there are sanctions for opposing council after this.

**(NARRATOR)**
But when the judge granted the plaintiff's motion, protecting the witnesses, Destiny’s story immediately changed. Suddenly, it was not only expected, it was appropriate.

`D_SealIsAppropriateNow.mp4`
**(DESTINY CLIP - from nFF-vjs3P2s.mp4)**
There's nothing wrong with them filing stuff under seal especially for a case like this. I think it's appropriate. This, I think it's appropriate.

**(NARRATOR)**
He's not a manipulator. He just happens to threaten his critics. He doesn't abuse the system, he just rewrites legal reality moment to moment. His outrage is a performance, tailored for an audience he assumes won't check the receipts. He accuses jstlk of weaponizing Chaeiry, while Destiny himself has a documented history of sharing intimate images of multiple women without consent.

`D_SharingNudesHistory.mp4`
**(DESTINY CLIP - from Y91C-2onTSs.mp4)**
I had one that was 15... she sent me pictures that made it so hard to say no.

`D_AdmittingMolinaNoConsent.mp4`
**(DESTINY CLIP - from Y91C-2onTSs.mp4)**
...if you're going to send any videos to new girls that we haven't talked about, like let me know that first... I didn't think about it at the time cuz I didn't think it mattered.

**(NARRATOR)**
So yes, jstlk and Chaeiry are dating. They kept it private. When it came out, it was messy. But the real story isn't their relationship. It's about how that relationship was immediately seized upon and weaponized by a man facing federal charges for sex-based offenses, in a desperate attempt to poison the well against anyone who dares to report on it. He calls jstlk and his community a disease.

`D_HerpesAnalogy.mp4`
**(DESTINY CLIP)**
I think that Kiwi Farms and Justicle is kind of like that reservoir... they're kind of like herpes. So, there are certain infections in your body... and what'll happen is is every now and then for some reason... they will eject all of their unhinged into some public form.

**(NARRATOR)**
An interesting analogy. A latent disease that flares up under stress. For Destiny, every new revelation, every legal setback, every critical voice seems to trigger a flare-up of projection, slander, and hypocrisy. He sees manipulators and abusers everywhere, perhaps because it saves him the trouble of looking in a mirror. He sees himself as the perpetual victim in a story he writes, directs, and stars in.

`D_NedStark.mp4`
**(DESTINY CLIP)**
What Game of Thrones are you? I'm Ned Stark. Getting beheaded every single season over and over and over again.
