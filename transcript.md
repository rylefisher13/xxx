### **YouTube Script: The Herpes Defense**

**(Intro Music - tense, investigative)**

**NARRATOR:**
In the online world, drama is currency. But sometimes, a public spectacle isn't just about the spectacle itself. Sometimes, it's a smokescreen. Recently, news broke that jstlk, a creator known for his critical coverage of streamer Destiny, had been in a relationship with Chaeiry, one of the many women who have made public allegations against Destiny. The relationship ended, and like many things online, it became public and messy.

For most, this is a private matter made public. For Destiny, it was an opportunity.

`clip_01_herpes_analogy.mp4`
**DESTINY (CLIP):** I would describe people like Kiwi Farms or just call them is so kind of like herpes... they hide in places... and what will happen is, is every now and then, for some reason, they the cells turn on and they're like, oh, we're going to go make a bunch of friends... they will eject all of their unhinged shit into some public forum.

**NARRATOR:**
This is how Destiny, a man currently being sued in federal court for allegedly distributing intimate images without consent, describes his critics. Not with argument, but with dehumanization. The facts of the matter are simple: two people dated, and it ended. But the story isn't about them. It's about why Destiny is so eager to turn their private lives into a public execution.

**(Part 1: The Character Assassination)**

**NARRATOR:**
Destinyâ€™s strategy is simple: paint jstlk, the critic, as a master manipulator. He seizes on a tweet from months ago where Chaeiry described a conversation with jstlk.

`clip_02_dr_k.mp4`
**DESTINY (CLIP):** I think when just told me I am Reckful and he is doctor K and he promises to be my friend for two years no matter what... So I feel like that is an unbelievably unhinged thing to say... when cherry said that just it would be her doctor K that looked like some insane fucking manipulation to me.

**NARRATOR:**
He then builds his case, framing jstlk's coverage of him as an elaborate, year-long deception to get closer to Chaeiry.

`clip_03_conflict_of_interest.mp4`
**DESTINY (CLIP):** So the person who was making accusations about me and then was on jet stream as he supposed to be, supposedly the impartial person covering things... happened to be dating one of the people who was in the process of leaving her husband for him. I feel like that's, what do you say? Conflict of interest a little bit or something. Maybe that is worth disclosing.

**NARRATOR:**
And for the finishing touch, he digs up an old, ironic message from jstlk, presenting it as a smoking gun of hypocrisy.

`clip_04_never_fuck_community.mp4`
**DESTINY (CLIP):** I will literally never fuck somebody from this community in a million years. Book it and cancel me if I ever fail to live up to this.

**NARRATOR:**
A "gotcha." A clear narrative painting jstlk as a liar and a predator. According to Destiny, this isn't just a messy breakup; it's a conspiracy. A convenient one, which positions his chief critic as morally bankrupt. But when you accuse someone of being a master manipulator, it helps if you aren't one yourself.

**(Part 2: The Pot, The Kettle, The Void)**

**NARRATOR:**
Destiny works hard to portray himself as the opposite of this manipulative archetype. He claims his real flaw is that he just checks out.

`clip_05_dismissive_avoidant.mp4`
**DESTINY (CLIP):** My biggest problem in relationships is actually very consistently that I just disconnect too much... my toxic coping mechanism, I guess, is I have a very dismissive avoidant personality. I'll just stop talking to that person.

**NARRATOR:**
A "dismissive avoidant" personality. Let's look at what that looks like in practice.

**(Fast-paced montage of the following clips with minimal, sharp cuts)**

`clip_06_doxxing_anna.mp4`
**DESTINY (CLIP from Y91C-2onTSs):** Somebody on Kiwi Farms has made a thread of Anna. So if you are obsessed with Anna and you want to talk about her all the time... you can actually go to Kiwi Farms and you can go and post all you want...

`clip_07_text_to_anna.mp4`
**(Text on screen from Y91C-2onTSs showing Destiny's message: "You're doing it to yourself and you're going to keep doing it to yourself.")**

`clip_08_choking_admission.mp4`
**DESTINY (CLIP from Y91C-2onTSs):** ...cuz you better believe I had to choke her out a few times. That got crazy.

`clip_09_grinder_recording.mp4`
**(Audio from Y91C-2onTSs of the grinder recording without consent plays over a black screen)**

**NARRATOR:**
This isn't "disconnecting." This is a pattern of targeted harassment, admitted violence, and non-consensual recording. He accuses jstlk of manipulation while his own history reads like a case study in it. Which begs the question... why this intense focus, right now?

---

**(Part 3: The Real Motive)**

**NARRATOR:**
The answer is in his own words. This was never about jstlk or Chaeiry's relationship. It's about his court case. Watch as he pivots from their drama to his own legal defense, attempting to use Chaeiry's emotional tweets as a tool to discredit another witness against him.

`clip_10_legal_pivot.mp4`
**DESTINY (CLIP):** Cherry was sending stuff to Abby and Abby never thought to mention to cherry that I had supposedly sent stuff to Abby of Cherry because it was all bullshit... And remember, Abby is the only thing that is keeping the current case against me alive. Abby's testimony is the only thing that gives subject matter jurisdiction to the federal court... And this is just kind of like another pin in the cushion that Abby is lying about everything, basically.

**NARRATOR:**
He's not just airing drama. He is actively attempting to poison the well, using one alleged victim's pain to publicly discredit another, all in service of his federal lawsuit. This behavior isn't new. He has a history of lying about his court proceedings to his audience. He spent weeks attacking his opponents for filing to seal witness identities...

`clip_11_lying_about_court_1.mp4`
**DESTINY (CLIP from nFF-vjs3P2s):** I hope there are sanctions for opposing council after this... because they've violated like several rules at this point.

**NARRATOR:**
...only to pretend it was completely expected and normal when the judge granted their motion.

`clip_12_lying_about_court_2.mp4`
**DESTINY (CLIP from nFF-vjs3P2s):** Is this supposed to be a loss?... there's nothing wrong with them filing stuff under seal especially for a case like this i think it's appropriate.

**NARRATOR:**
It's a pattern of deception. Attack, misdirect, and lie to control the narrative. And when he's not actively trying to manipulate a legal outcome, this is how he talks about his critics.

`clip_13_kill_jstlk.mp4`
**DESTINY (CLIP from Y91C-2onTSs):** I do want somebody to kill jstlk though...

**(Conclusion: The Pattern)**

**NARRATOR:**
Towards the end of his stream, Destiny laments how his own actions are perceived versus those of his opponents.

`clip_14_calculated_evil.mp4`
**DESTINY (CLIP):** I like how if I ever do anything wrong, ever, it's actually calculated from the time of birth to be the most evil and unhinged and terrible, horrible, evil manipulative shit ever... But I like how now when just tickle... that's all just a oopsie. That was just, people are just making dumb, selfish decisions. OOPSes.

**NARRATOR:**
He's right. There is a difference. When one person has a documented, decade-long pattern of admitted assault, non-consensual recordings, doxxing, and targeted harassment, you stop calling it an "oopsie." You start calling it calculated.

Maybe the herpes analogy was correct after all. An opportunistic infection, flaring up to attack not just critics, but the very concept of accountability, all while trying to convince you it's just a common cold.

**(Slow fade out on the last line, followed by a montage of the following clips from Y91C-2onTSs with no narration, just somber music.)**

`clip_15_friends_condemn_montage.mp4`
**(Clips of Hasan, Dan, and others from Y91C-2onTSs expressing their disappointment and condemnation)**

**(Final text on a black screen):**
*Destiny is currently being sued in federal court for the unauthorized distribution of intimate images.*
*He is also reportedly under investigation for recording individuals without their consent.*

**(End screen)**
