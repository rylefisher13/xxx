**(Video opens with a cold open. Quick, tense cuts of Destiny looking stressed on stream, headlines about his federal lawsuit, and the words "DEFLECTION," "SLANDER," and "MANIPULATION" flashing on screen.)**

**(Music swells and cuts abruptly)**

**VOICEOVER:**\
When you're facing a federal lawsuit for distributing intimate images and potential charges for illegal recording, what do you do? If you're Steven "Destiny" Bonnell, you don't reflect. You don't show remorse. You go on the attack. You create a smokescreen. And that's exactly what he just did.

Recently, it was revealed that streamer Jstlk and Chaeiry---a key figure and potential witness in the allegations against Destiny---are in a relationship. This is a private matter between two consenting adults. But for Destiny, it was an opportunity. An opportunity to slander a critic, discredit a victim, and try to rewrite a narrative that's rapidly collapsing around him.

Today, we're not going to defend Jstlk and Chaeiry. The facts of their relationship are their own. We're going to use Destiny's own words to show you his playbook: a desperate, calculated campaign of deflection built on hypocrisy, logical fallacies, and outright lies.

FILENAME: DESTINY_HERPES_ANALOGY.mp4\
**VOICEOVER:**\
Let's start with how Destiny views his critics. He doesn't see them as people with legitimate grievances. He sees them as a disease.

**DESTINY (from transcript):**\
I would describe people like Kiwi Farms or just call them is so kind of like herpes. So there are certain infections in your body... what will happen is, is anytime you get into a fight with somebody, for me, if I get into a fight with somebody, if they find a way to kind of like flare up, they will eject all of their unhinged shit into some public forum.

**VOICEOVER:**\
Dehumanizing language. He paints Jstlk not as a former collaborator who left over ethical concerns, but as a parasitic infection. This isn't an argument; it's a smear tactic designed to poison the well from the very beginning. And the poison is meant to distract from his own behavior.

FILENAME: DESTINY_ACCUSES_JSTLK_DR_K.mp4\
**VOICEOVER:**\
Destiny spends a significant portion of his stream trying to paint Jstlk as a master manipulator. His primary evidence? A tweet from Chaeiry where she claims Jstlk offered to be her "Dr. K" to guide her.

**DESTINY (from transcript):**\
So I feel like that is an unbelievably unhinged thing to say to somebody that he told her he was going to be her doctor. K... when cherry said that just it would be her doctor K that looked like some insane fucking manipulation to me.

**VOICEOVER:**\
"Insane fucking manipulation." A bold claim from a man whose own history is littered with accusations of the very same thing.

**(Quick cuts to screenshots/text on screen from the "notes" context)**

-   His ex-wife Melina has publicly stated Destiny gaslit her about his affair with Lauren Southern, told her she was crazy, and lied to their couples therapist.

    -   He has self-admittedly used sexting to "control" former associate Anavoir.

FILENAME: DESTINY_AVOIDANT_PERSONALITY.mp4\
**VOICEOVER:**\
He even admits his own toxic coping mechanism isn't manipulation, it's just... abandoning people.

**DESTINY (from transcript):**\
My biggest problem in relationships is actually very consistently that I just disconnect too much... I have a very dismissive avoidant personality. I'll just stop talking to that person.

**VOICEOVER:**\
He accuses Jstlk of a secret, manipulative relationship while conveniently ignoring his own documented history of gaslighting, infidelity, and emotional abandonment. This is classic projection.

FILENAME: DESTINY_UNRELIABLE_NARRATOR.mp4\
**VOICEOVER:**\
But the most blatant, telling moment of hypocrisy comes down to this single, revealing sentence.

**DESTINY (from transcript):**\
So cherry obviously is an unreliable narrator, unless she's making accusations against me and she's the most reliable ally writer. But if we take anything she's saying here to be true at all...

**VOICEOVER:**\
Did you catch that? He jokes about the double standard and then immediately engages in it. Chaeiry is "unreliable"... except when her words can be used as a weapon against his "op," Jstlk. Then, suddenly, her claims are taken at face value. This isn't an honest analysis; it's motivated reasoning. He doesn't care about the truth; he cares about what's convenient for his narrative.

FILENAME: DESTINY_SPECULATES_DATING_TIMELINE.mp4\
**VOICEOVER:**\
And that narrative needs Jstlk to be a villain. So, Destiny invents a timeline out of thin air, admitting it's pure conjecture, to create a "conflict of interest" story.

**DESTINY (from transcript):**\
I think they started dating a lot earlier. If I had to guess, I'm super reaching, like, conjecture. Whatever. Here. But I guess they probably were dating before January... The person who was making accusations about me and then was on jet stream as he supposed to be, supposedly the impartial person covering things... happened to be dating one of the people... I feel like that's, What do you say? Conflict of interest a little bit or something.

**VOICEOVER:**\
He admits he's "super reaching," then states it as a premise for an attack. This entire spectacle is designed to do one thing: discredit the people who are holding him accountable, just as his legal troubles mount.

FILENAME: DESTINY_DISMISSES_ABBY.mp4\
**VOICEOVER:**\
He even uses this situation to attack the credibility of his federal lawsuit, claiming that because a witness named Abby didn't mention something to Chaeiry, the entire case against him is built on lies.

**DESTINY (from transcript):**\
And remember, Abby is the only thing that is keeping the current case against me alive. Abby's testimony is the only thing that gives subject matter jurisdiction... And this is just kind of like another pin in the cushion that Abby is lying about everything, basically.

**VOICEOVER:**\
See the pattern? A private relationship is twisted into a public spectacle to cast doubt on critics, witnesses, and the very legal case that threatens his career. It's a textbook smear campaign. And it's built on a foundation of lies that stretch back months.

**(Transition to showing contradictions from older videos)**

**VOICEOVER:**\
Destiny's bad faith isn't new. He consistently lies and contradicts himself, especially about his court case. He tailors his narrative to whatever makes him look best in the moment. Take the issue of sealing witness identities.

FILENAME: NFF_VJS3P2S_AGAINST_SEAL.mp4\
**VOICEOVER:**\
When he thought he could paint Pixie's lawyers as incompetent, he claimed their attempts to protect witnesses were improper and against the rules.

**DESTINY (from **\
...you can't file stuff under seal and keep it from the defense you just can't do that i don't know why they keep trying to make this argument that they can...

FILENAME: NFF_VJS3P2S_FOR_SEAL.mp4\
**VOICEOVER:**\
But when the judge granted their motion, he immediately flip-flopped, pretending it was normal and expected all along.

**DESTINY (from **\
There's nothing wrong with them filing stuff under seal especially for a case like this i think it's appropriate.

**VOICEOVER:**\
The hypocrisy is staggering. And what about witness intimidation?

FILENAME: 3QV13EDLMWY_INTIMIDATION_DENIAL.mp4\
**VOICEOVER:**\
He mocks the very idea of it as an "internet" concern that has no place in a real court.

**DESTINY (from **\
...and witness intimidation and harassment are real and ongoing concerns. Yeah, welcome to the internet. You don't think I get intimidated and harassed?

FILENAME: NFF_VJS3P2S_THREATS.mp4\
**VOICEOVER:**\
And yet, here he is, on stream, making explicit death threats against people involved in this very drama, including Jstlk.

**DESTINY (from **\
I do want someone to kill the school though or lav or Mr orman all those people can go die.

**VOICEOVER:**\
He claims he's a victim of harassment one minute, then threatens to have his critics killed the next. He says protecting witnesses is improper, then says it's appropriate. This isn't a man arguing in good faith. This is a man who will say anything to win.

FILENAME: DESTINY_PERFECT_RECORD_CLAIM.mp4\
**VOICEOVER:**\
He even tries to paint himself as a bewildered victim of a sudden, coordinated attack, erasing his own long and sordid history.

**DESTINY (from transcript):**\
And I've never my life like run into stuff like this. And then all of a sudden in the last like year, apparently every single fucking person was like, actually, Jesus.

**VOICEOVER:**\
"Never run into stuff like this." A perfect record? Let's be clear. This is the man who:\
**(Text appears on screen for each point)**

-   Cheated on his first wife.

    -   Was exposed for getting off to pictures of underage fans.

    -   Leaked a woman's nudes in an act of revenge.

    -   Sexually assaulted a woman on a livestream.

    -   Passed STDs without disclosure.

    -   And cheated on his second wife.

This isn't a sudden conspiracy. It's a pattern of behavior, and the consequences are finally catching up to him.

FILENAME: OUTRO_MONTAGE.mp4\
**(Music begins to build again. Slow-motion clips of Destiny speaking, intercut with screenshots of his contradictory statements and the legal documents.)**

**VOICEOVER:**\
So when you watch Destiny lash out at Jstlk and Chaeiry, don't see it as just more online drama. See it for what it is: the desperate flailing of a man caught in a web of his own making. He is not a victim. He is not an impartial commentator. He is a defendant in a federal case, actively trying to discredit and intimidate anyone who poses a threat to his image and his freedom.

He's comparing his critics to a disease, projecting his own manipulative behavior onto others, and lying about his own history, all while his legal walls close in. This isn't about truth. It's about control. And he's losing it.

**(Screen goes to black.)**
