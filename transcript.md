### **YouTube Script: The Projection Playbook**

**(NARRATION)**
Prolific streamer Destiny, currently facing a federal lawsuit for the alleged distribution of intimate images without consent, has found a new target for his scrutiny. Not his own legal battles, but the private relationship of two of his most prominent critics: the streamer jstlk, and Chaeiry, one of the women who has accused Destiny of wrongdoing. The revelation that jstlk and Chaeiry are dating has become a new narrative weapon for Destiny. But as we'll see, every accusation he levels seems to be a page torn directly from his own playbook.

**(NARRATION)**
Let's briefly cover the facts. Jstlk and Chaeiry are in a relationship. For most, this would be a private matter. For Destiny, it's an opportunity. He immediately frames it as a grand conspiracy, a conflict of interest designed to harm him. He begins by comparing his critics to a disease.

`destiny_herpes_analogy.mp4`
> **DESTINY:** I would describe people like Kiwi Farms or just call them is so kind of like herpes... they hide in places... anytime you get into a fight with somebody, for me, if I get into a fight with somebody, if they find a way to kind of like flare up, they will eject all of their unhinged shit into some public forum.

**(NARRATION)**
An interesting analogy, considering Destiny has his own history with that platform. While being sued, he publicly complained about his *own* intimate videos remaining on Kiwi Farms, effectively directing his audience to the very "reservoir" he now decries.

`3qV13EdLmWY-directing-to-kiwifarms.mp4`
> **DESTINY (older clip):** ...directing his followers to the Kiwi Farm site again that's another super gross mischaracterization of me complaining that all of my revenge is still being openly hosted on Kiwi Farms.

**(NARRATION)**
Destiny's central attack on jstlk hinges on a series of tweets from Chaeiry, made during a moment of personal crisis. When Chaeiry's tweets are aimed at jstlk, Destiny presents them as infallible truth, reading them with dramatic conviction.

`destiny_reads_dr_k_tweet.mp4`
> **DESTINY:** I think when just told me I am Reckful and he is doctor K and he promises to be my friend for two years no matter what... He means for me to depend on him so that I eventually kill myself like Reckful did.

**(NARRATION)**
He continues, building a narrative of jstlk as a master manipulator, based entirely on these tweets.

`destiny_reads_lovebomb_tweet.mp4`
> **DESTINY:** Jessica said he'd delete everything if I told people he wanted to be with me. But after being on call with me for 16 hours and not giving me a single reason to live and telling me he will never love me and never wanted to be with me. I think he's loved bombing and abandoning me until I break.

**(NARRATION)**
But watch how his standard for truth suddenly shifts. When Chaeiry's accusations are against *him*, she's immediately dismissed.

`destiny_unreliable_narrator.mp4`
> **DESTINY:** So cherry obviously is an unreliable narrator, unless she's making accusations against me and she's the most reliable ally writer.

**(NARRATION)**
It's a stunningly transparent double standard. Chaeiry's words are gospel when aimed at his "op," but the ramblings of an "unreliable narrator" when they implicate him. He then moves from selective belief to pure fabrication, admitting he's just guessing about the relationship's timeline before immediately treating his guess as fact to build his "conflict of interest" case.

`destiny_baseless_speculation.mp4`
> **DESTINY:** I think that, I think they started dating a lot earlier. If I had to guess, I'm super reaching, like, conjecture. Whatever. Here. But I guess they probably were dating before January. Like before this year. They've been dating for probably about a year...

`destiny_conflict_of_interest.mp4`
> **DESTINY:** ...the person who was making accusations about me and then was on jet stream as he supposed to be, supposedly the impartial person covering things... happened to be dating one of the people who was in the process of leaving her husband for him. I feel like that's, What do you say? Conflict of interest a little bit or something. Maybe that is worth disclosing.

**(NARRATION)**
A conflict of interest. An interesting concern from a man who once famously declared he would never, ever get involved with someone from his own community.

`destiny_never_fuck_community.mp4`
> **DESTINY:** I will literally never fuck somebody from this community in a million years. Book it and cancel me if I ever fail to live up to this.

**(NARRATION)**
Destiny's core defense of his own character is that he isn't manipulative. He claims his toxic trait is simply to withdraw.

`destiny_claims_im_not_manipulative.mp4`
> **DESTINY:** But I don't really do this type of shit. Like the crazy manipulator stuff... my biggest problem in relationships is actually very consistently that I just disconnect too much... I have a very dismissive avoidant personality. I'll just stop talking.

**(NARRATION)**
"Dismissive avoidant." A stark contrast to his own self-admitted past behavior, where he allegedly continued to sext a woman specifically to "control" her. As he casts judgment, he positions himself as a bastion of transparency, unlike his critics. Yet, this is the same man who, just months ago, spent weeks misleading his audience about court procedures, only to completely flip his story when the judge ruled against him.

`nFF-vjs3P2s-contradiction-compilation.mp4`
> **DESTINY (compilation of older clips):** I don't even think they should be granted any protection of the witness identities at this point... you can't file stuff under seal and keep it from the defense you just can't do that i don't know why they keep trying to make this argument... **(CUT TO)** There's nothing wrong with them filing stuff under seal especially for a case like this i think it's appropriate this i think it's appropriate.

**(NARRATION)**
Destiny's own online critics see the pattern clearly, reading their comments aloud on his stream, only to dismiss them.

`destiny_reads_projection_comment.mp4`
> **DESTINY (reading comment):** Destiny is 100% going to try to reach out to cherry. It's the projection right here. He's already planting the seeds of. Look, Jessica was fucking you to get close to me. He's so transparent... Destiny. Your manipulation tactics are so transparent.

**(NARRATION)**
He dismisses this as the fantasy of a "gang stalking" community. Yet, his own words reveal the strategy. He minimizes his own alleged crimes while painting jstlk's relationship issues as a calculated, evil plot.

`destiny_jstlk_was_just_a_dick.mp4`
> **DESTINY:** I like how if I ever do anything wrong, ever. It's actually calculated... to be the most evil and unhinged and terrible, horrible, evil manipulative shit ever... But I like how now when just tickle who's been bringing cherry on to a stream knowing that she is like mentally unwell... while secretly dating her... paying her... telling her that he was gonna be a doctor K... That's all just a UPS. That was just, people are just making dumb, selfish decisions. OOPSes.

**(NARONATION)**
He frames jstlk's "dumb, selfish decisions" as a nefarious scheme, while his own conduct, which has led to a federal lawsuit, should presumably be seen as a simple "oops." The projection is breathtaking. This was never about a messy breakup. It's an attempt to smear a critic and discredit an accuser. It's a deflection tactic from a man under serious legal fire, who accuses others of the very behavior he himself is known for. It’s not just a defense; it’s a confession by projection.
