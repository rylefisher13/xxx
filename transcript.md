### **YouTube Video Title:** Destiny's Smokescreen: The Anatomy of a Slander Campaign

### **Video Description:**
As Destiny faces a federal lawsuit for distributing intimate images and potential charges for non-consensual recording, a new drama conveniently takes center stage. But is it a real scandal, or a calculated smokescreen to discredit his accusers and critics? We analyze Destiny's recent stream attacking jstlk and Chaeiry, breaking down the fallacies, contradictions, and the transparent attempt to control a narrative that's slipping from his grasp.

### **YouTube Script**

**(Video opens with a cold, fast-paced montage of clips with minimal, sharp editing. Low, tense background music starts.)**

`destiny_i_dont_manipulate.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip 45:56):** "The idea that I would have the time to like go through and do the crazy manipulator game... I just don't have the interest for it. I don't care."

`destiny_threatens_jstlk.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip from Y91C-2onTSs):** "For Jstlk? I'd... if I could I'd [unintelligible] the house and do it."

`destiny_victim_blames_anna.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip from Y91C-2onTSs):** "You're doing it to yourself. And you're going to keep doing it to yourself."

`destiny_claims_im_ned_stark.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip 1:15:22):** "What Game of Thrones are you? I'm Ned Stark. Getting beheaded every single season over and over and over again."

**(Music cuts abruptly. Screen goes to black. Title card appears.)**

**TITLE CARD: THE SMOKESCREEN**

**(Calm, analytical narrator voice begins over neutral B-roll footage of code, legal documents, or abstract graphics.)**

**NARRATOR:**
For months, streamer Steven "Destiny" Bonnell has been embroiled in serious legal trouble. He's the defendant in a federal lawsuit under the Cardi B Act for allegedly distributing intimate images without consent. He faces police investigations for non-consensual recordings. And his public image has been challenged by former friends and partners.

**(B-roll shows blurred headlines about Destiny's lawsuit.)**

**NARRATOR:**
One of the most consistent voices covering these allegations has been jstlk, a former orbiter who left Destiny's circle after the controversies came to light. One of the alleged victims at the center of this is Chaeiry, who has filed a police report against Destiny.

This is the backdrop. The established conflict. But recently, a new narrative has been aggressively pushed by Destiny. The catalyst? The revelation that jstlk and Chaeiry are, and have been, dating. For Destiny, this wasn't just gossip. It was ammunition.

### **Part 1: The Accusation**

`destiny_hater_and_rapist.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip 29:20):** "So jstlk, my number one fan turned hater, who has decided to cover me as basically rapist for the past six months..."

**NARRATOR:**
On a recent stream, Destiny dedicated hours to a new thesis: that jstlk is a sinister manipulator, and Chaeiry is his unstable pawn. He paints a picture of a conflict of interest so profound, it should invalidate all criticism against him.

`destiny_conflict_of_interest.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip 43:53):** "The person who was making accusations about me and then was on justical stream as he's supposed to be supposedly the impartial person covering things... happened to be dating one of the people... I feel like that's a conflict of interest a little bit."

**NARRATOR:**
He focuses on a tweet where Chaeiry, in distress, claimed jstlk offered to be her "Dr. K"—a reference to the popular Twitch therapist—to guide her.

`destiny_dr_k_manipulation.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip 46:29):** "When Chaeiry said that jstlk would be her Dr. K, that looked like some insane manipulation to me."

**NARRATOR:**
The narrative is clear: jstlk isn't a journalist or a commentator. He's a predator, using a vulnerable woman to wage a personal vendetta. Chaeiry isn't a victim of Destiny's alleged actions; she's a victim of jstlk's mind games.

`destiny_mindfucked.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip 46:35):** "...it wouldn't surprise me if Chaeiry has unironically gotten unbelievably mindfucked into the next dimension by this community group of people."

**NARRATOR:**
It's a compelling story. But it relies entirely on one thing: that you forget everything you know about Destiny himself.

---
### **Part 2: The Projector**

**(Music shifts to a more inquisitive, mysterious tone.)**

**NARRATOR:**
Destiny's central accusation against jstlk is one of covert manipulation and exploiting a personal relationship for public gain. Let's place that accusation next to Destiny's own well-documented history.

**(Split screen. On one side, Destiny's clip about "insane manipulation." On the other, clips from the context videos.)**

`anna_dox_thread.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip from Y91C-2onTSs):** "Somebody on Kiwi Farms has made a thread of Anna. So if you are obsessed with Anna... you can actually go to Kiwi Farms and you can go and post all you want."

**NARRATOR:**
This is Destiny directing his audience to a harassment forum to discuss his then-secret partner, Anna. When she confronted him, telling him he'd ruined her life and put her in danger...

`destiny_victim_blames_anna.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip from Y91C-2onTSs):** "You're doing it to yourself. And you're going to keep doing it to yourself."

**NARRATOR:**
Destiny claims jstlk has a "conflict of interest" for platforming someone he was dating. Yet, for over a year, Destiny maintained a relationship with Anna while simultaneously engaging in public feuds with her, discussing her on stream, and directing his audience to threads doxing her.

`destiny_admits_anna_relationship.mp4`
**Interviewer (from Y91C-2onTSs):** "So you acknowledge that you've been with her for a year?"
**Destiny (from Y91C-2onTSs):** "I think, yeah, we've had on and off, sure."

**NARRATOR:**
He accuses jstlk of holding his community "hostage" over Chaeiry.

`destiny_jstlk_hostage.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip 1:06:19):** "...holding her only friend group, his community, hostage by telling her that if she ever went public with their relationship that he would delete all of it."

**NARRATOR:**
This, while Destiny himself has a history of making violent threats against his critics, including jstlk, and has been accused by multiple women of sharing their intimate images and recordings—the ultimate form of relational violation.

`destiny_choke_out_rachel.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip from Y91C-2onTSs):** "...you better believe I had to choke her out a few times. That got crazy. Hell yeah, it did."

**NARRATOR:**
The criticism he levels at jstlk isn't just a double standard. It's a projection. He's describing his own patterns of behavior and attributing them to his primary critic. He frames himself as the simple, non-manipulative one...

`destiny_claims_too_much_disconnect.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip 45:49):** "...my biggest problem in relationships is actually very consistently that I just disconnect too much."

**NARRATOR:**
...while his former friends and partners describe something very different.

`dan_friends_say.mp4`
**Dan (Clip from Y91C-2onTSs):** "...what occurred and what I've seen is completely and totally unacceptable and horrible."
**Pisco (Clip from Y91C-2onTSs):** "...when he engages in like actual behavior that I think is reprehensible and I'm like 'Bro what are you doing this is stupid' and his response is 'I like to have fun I don't care.' Then there's just got to be a come point where I'm like 'Art then I just got to cut you off.'"

---
### **Part 3: The Legal Deflection**

**NARRATOR:**
This entire drama serves another, more critical purpose for Destiny: it's a way to re-litigate his federal case on his own terms, outside the scrutiny of a judge. He uses Chaeiry's tweets not just to attack jstlk, but to poison the well against the witnesses in his own lawsuit.

`destiny_connects_to_case.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip 47:52):** "Chaeiry was in contact with Abby after all of this stuff broke. Chaeiry was sending stuff to Abby and Abby never thought to mention to Chaeiry that I had supposedly sent stuff to Abby of Chaeiry... this is just kind of like another pin in the cushion that Abby is lying about everything basically."

**NARRATOR:**
He presents himself as a master legal analyst, confidently explaining the case to his audience. But his on-stream analysis is consistently contradicted by the facts, and even by his own prior statements. He spent weeks claiming the plaintiff's attorneys were filing motions improperly...

`jstlk_shows_contradiction_1.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip from nFF-vjs3P2s):** "You just can't do that. I don't know why they keep trying to make this argument that they can."

**NARRATOR:**
...only to completely reverse his position when the judge ruled against him, pretending it was the expected outcome all along.

`jstlk_shows_contradiction_2.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip from nFF-vjs3P2s):** "There's nothing wrong with them filing stuff under seal, especially for a case like this. I think it's appropriate."

**NARRATOR:**
He mocks the plaintiff's legal filings...

`destiny_mocks_sloppy_filings.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip from 3qV13EdLmWY):** "Their filings have honestly been so sloppy I don't even think they should be granted any protection of the witness..."

**NARRATOR:**
...while misinterpreting the very laws he's being sued under.

`destiny_cardi_misinterpretation.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip from 3qV13EdLmWY):** "...that's important because the later uh claims that they cite uh do not count as just singular transfer, you have to publish it on an internet public website."

`esportsbatman_rebuttal.mp4`
**jstlk/EsportsBatman (Clip from 3qV13EdLmWY):** *(Text on screen shows the actual law)* "Keyword is 'disclosed' in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce... Sending it to a single person does count."

**NARRATOR:**
This isn't an unbiased legal commentary. It's a performance designed to convince his audience that the entire legal system is corrupt, his accusers are liars, and their lawyers are incompetent. The jstlk and Chaeiry drama is just the latest act in this performance.

---
### **Part 4: The Unreliable Narrator**

**NARRATOR:**
Throughout this entire saga, Destiny's most powerful tool is his ability to define reality for his audience. He decides who is credible and who is not, based entirely on whether they serve his narrative. Chaeiry is the perfect example of this.

When she accuses him, she's mentally ill, obsessed, and a liar.

`destiny_calls_her_disgusting.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip 31:42):** "I've hated Kelly for a long time. I think she was legitimately like a disgusting like female like loser."

`destiny_cherry_unreliable.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip 39:26):** "So Chaeiry obviously is an unreliable uh narrator..."

**NARRATOR:**
But the moment her words can be aimed at jstlk, she is suddenly a tragic victim of manipulation whose claims must be taken seriously.

`destiny_cherry_unreliable_but.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip 39:26):** "...unless she's making accusations against me, then she's the most reliable narrator."

**(Pause for effect)**

**NARRATOR:**
He diagnoses her with "extreme mania," mocks her with "we love a BPD queen," and then, in the same breath, positions himself as the only one who truly understood her potential.

`destiny_whiplash_on_cherry.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip 52:01):** "I think that Chaeiry is actually a pretty intelligent and... a pretty funny person... when she is... managed, she actually does uh pretty good stuff."

**NARRATOR:**
He claims he has no sympathy for her, then immediately feigns concern to position himself as her would-be savior, contrasted with the "manipulator" jstlk.

`destiny_no_sympathy_but_actually.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip 45:00):** "To be fully honest, I have very little sympathy for Chaeiry... That being said, I do think that it's a little bit... one of the reasons why it's so fucked up that people make all these insane accusations about my behavior, right?"

**NARRATOR:**
He's not just an unreliable narrator. He's an adaptive one. He will adopt any position, feign any emotion, and contradict any prior statement if it helps him "win" the immediate conversation. His goal isn't truth; it's narrative dominance.

---
### **Conclusion: The Man Behind the Curtain**

**(Music becomes somber, conclusive.)**

**NARRATOR:**
When you strip away the layers of projection, deflection, and hypocrisy, what remains? A man facing serious federal allegations, who has found a convenient new target to absorb the negative attention. The relationship between jstlk and Chaeiry, whatever its complexities, is ultimately a sideshow. It's a fog of drama deployed to obscure the main event.

Destiny is not a passive commentator on this drama. He is its primary engine, fueled by a desperate need to discredit the people who threaten his career and his freedom. He paints jstlk as a manipulator to distract from his own documented history of it. He attacks the credibility of Chaeiry and other witnesses because their testimony is the foundation of the legal case against him.

`destiny_claims_no_manipulation_reprise.mp4`
**Destiny (Clip 1:14:50):** "Like I've I just have never done this. I don't do this stuff. And it's not even because I don't have the mind for it or because like I'm a good person. I just don't have the time or the inclination."

**NARRATOR:**
The real story isn't about who is dating whom. It's about a pattern of behavior. It's about a streamer who believes he can control every narrative, rewrite any history, and slander any critic into silence. The question is not whether jstlk had a conflict of interest. The question is why Destiny needs you to believe he did.

**(Fade to black.)**
