### **YouTube Script: Destiny's Desperate Deflection**


**NARRATOR:**\
Destiny, the streamer currently facing a federal lawsuit for the alleged distribution of intimate images without consent, is on the attack. But his target isn't the legal system or the evidence against him. His target is Jstlk---a creator who has covered the allegations---and Chaeiry, one of Destiny's own accusers. Why? Because it was revealed they are dating.

This isn't journalism. This is a calculated smear campaign from a man backed into a corner, and he's using the exact tactics he's accused of: manipulation, projection, and the weaponization of mental health. Today, we use his own words to expose his desperate attempt to whitewash his image by slinging mud at everyone else.

**(Cut to a dark screen with white text: PART 1: THE ACCUSATION)**

**NARRATOR:**\
Destiny begins by pathologizing his critics. He doesn't see them as people with legitimate grievances; he sees them as a disease.

[CLIP: main_transcript.mp4 | 00:00:17 - 00:00:47 (30 seconds)]\
**DESTINY:** "I would describe people like Kiwi Farms or just call them is so kind of like herpes... they hide in places... your immune system does not have access to every single area of your body..."

[CLIP: main_transcript.mp4 | 00:01:29 - 00:01:46 (17 seconds)]\
**DESTINY:** "...anytime you get into a fight with somebody, for me, if I get into a fight with somebody, if they find a way to kind of like flare up, they will eject all of their unhinged shit into some public forum."

**NARRATOR:**\
"Ejecting unhinged shit into a public forum." Remember that phrase. Destiny claims this is what Jstlk's community does. He also claims that communities built on hate are doomed to fail.

[CLIP: main_transcript.mp4 | 02:02:49 - 02:22:09 (20 seconds)]\
**DESTINY:** "...you can't like, hold a community together with hate... I've tried to prevent my community from becoming like unhinged snark or communities... it draws a certain type of fan."

**NARRATOR:**\
He's setting the stage. Jstlk is an unhinged, hate-filled parasite. Now, watch as he uses the news of Jstlk and Chaeiry's relationship to launch his main assault.

**(Cut to a dark screen with white text: PART 2: THE HYPOCRITE'S CRUSADE)**

**NARRATOR:**\
Destiny presents Chaeiry's tweets about her relationship with Jstlk. He reads them with a feigned sense of shock and concern, immediately positioning Jstlk as a predator.

[CLIP: main_transcript.mp4 | 14:14:39 - 14:36:33 (22 seconds)]\
**DESTINY:** "...if we take anything she's saying here to be true at all. Was he explicitly trying to keep his, I guess, relationship with her super private, and then telling her that if she leaked anything, he would delete his stream and everything else? The... only community that she had, the only friends she had."

**NARRATOR:**\
Suddenly, Destiny is the champion of Chaeiry, a woman he himself has been accused by. He smells a "conflict of interest."

[CLIP: main_transcript.mp4 | 18:38:15 - 18:56:10 (18 seconds)]\
**DESTINY:** "...the person who was making accusations about me and then was on jstlk stream as he supposed to be, supposedly the impartial person covering things... happened to be dating one of the people... I feel like that's, What do you say? Conflict of interest a little bit or something. Maybe that is worth disclosing."

**NARRATOR:**\
A conflict of interest. Let's talk about that. Jstlk, a commentator, was dating a source. That's a valid journalistic concern. But Destiny, the defendant in a federal lawsuit, using his massive platform to attack that same person---a potential witness against him---isn't just a conflict of interest. It's potential witness intimidation.

And this feigned concern for Chaeiry is a masterclass in manipulation. He needs you to believe Jstlk is the real manipulator, not him.

[CLIP: main_transcript.mp4 | 20:25:20 - 20:55:43 (30 seconds)]\
**DESTINY:** "...I don't really do this type of shit. Like the crazy manipulator stuff... my biggest problem in relationships is actually very consistently that I just disconnect too much... I have a very dismissive avoidant personality. I'll just stop talking to that person."

**NARRATOR:**\
He doesn't do the "crazy manipulator stuff." He's just "dismissive avoidant." This is a lie, and we have the receipts. Here he is, just last week, contradicting himself entirely on his past behavior.

**NARRATOR (Voice over on-screen text):**\
From his own mouth, he admitted to continuing a sexual relationship with a past accuser, Anavoir, specifically to "control" her.

**NARRATOR:**\
And here is his ex-wife, Melina, describing his behavior.

[PULL CLIP from notes/external source referencing Code Cave's comment about Melina]\
**NARRATOR (Voice over on-screen text):**\
"I could feel, I could sense something, but I got told that I was crazy and that what I felt was wrong, and like I got told to go to therapy. And then we went to therapy, and he also lied to the therapist."

**NARRATOR:**\
That's not "dismissive avoidant." That's classic gaslighting. The "crazy manipulator stuff" he claims he never does.

**(Cut to a dark screen with white text: PART 3: THE UNRELIABLE NARRATOR)**

**NARRATOR:**\
Destiny's entire attack on Jstlk hinges on the credibility of Chaeiry's emotional tweets. But watch how he describes her.

[CLIP: main_transcript.mp4 | 14:07:07 - 14:14:39 (7 seconds)]\
**DESTINY:** "So cherry obviously is an unreliable narrator, unless she's making accusations against me and she's the most reliable ally writer."

**NARRATOR:**\
He says it himself, sarcastically, but it reveals his entire strategy. Chaeiry is unreliable... until her words can be used as a weapon against his "op." When she accuses Jstlk, he treats her tweets as gospel. When she accuses Destiny, he dismisses her.

He then tries to paint himself as her former friend and champion, who was just so supportive.

[CLIP: main_transcript.mp4 | 36:51:15 - 37:14:55 (23 seconds)]\
**DESTINY:** "I was willing to maintain my friendship with her after she... me too'd me during the second time? No. Even after the second time, I was still friendly with her... and also all of this while not like telling her that I would be her fucking doctor K either."

**NARRATOR:**\
He's trying to get in her head. He's positioning himself as the 'good guy' compared to Jstlk. His own critics see this for what it is: a transparent attempt to get back in her good graces, now that she may be a key witness in a criminal investigation against him.

[CLIP: main_transcript.mp4 | 38:44:21 - 39:02:49 (18 seconds)]\
**DESTINY:** "Paving the way to get cherry to be comfortable with Destiny again, to drop the charges. Drop... what? ... He doesn't actually think cherry was manipulated. He's saying this to make her think he views her as a victim."

**NARRATOR:**\
He reads his critics' correct analysis and dismisses it as projection, while simultaneously proving their point by treating Chaeiry with this strange, calculated kid-gloves approach.

**(Cut to a dark screen with white text: PART 4: WHITEWASHING THE LAW)**

**NARRATOR:**\
This entire drama is a smokescreen for his own legal peril. And his commentary on it is filled with contradictions. He consistently tries to downplay the severity of the case against him, claiming it all hinges on one person's testimony which he claims is a lie.

[CLIP: main_transcript.mp4 | 22:55:00 - 23:27:42 (32 seconds)]\
**DESTINY:** "And remember, Abby is the only thing that is keeping the current case against me alive. Abby's testimony is the only thing that gives subject matter jurisdiction... the entire court case right now is resting on her testimony because she has no proof... And this is just kind of like another pin in the cushion that Abby is lying about everything, basically."

**NARRATOR:**\
This is the same man who, in the past, has repeatedly lied about the legal proceedings. He fought furiously against motions to seal witness identities, only to pretend it was expected and normal when he lost.

[PULL CLIP:nFF-vjs3P2s.mp4| 06:13 - 06:20 (7 seconds)]\
**DESTINY (THEN):** "The documents be filed under seal are repetitive wordy, improperly formatted... The court should constrain plaintiff to the 10-page limit..."

[PULL CLIP:nFF-vjs3P2s.mp4| 02:15 - 02:19 (4 seconds)]\
**DESTINY (NOW):** "There's nothing wrong with them filing stuff under seal especially for a case like this i think it's appropriate this i think it's appropriate."

**NARRATOR:**\
He presents two faces to his audience. One, where he's an aggressive litigant fighting for transparency. The other, a calm analyst who knew this was the outcome all along. It's whatever serves his image in the moment. He lies, and he does it with contempt for his audience's intelligence.

[PULL CLIP:3qV13EdLmWY.mp4| 00:44 - 00:49 (5 seconds)]\
**DESTINY:** "...Destiny calls some of Jane Doe's claims and her request to seal the hearing transcript hilarious and ridiculous."

[PULL CLIP:3qV13EdLmWY.mp4| 02:02 - 02:07 (5 seconds)]\
**DESTINY:** "There's nothing wrong with them filing stuff under seal especially for a case like this i think it's appropriate..."

**NARRATOR:**\
He doesn't just contradict himself. He accuses Jstlk of the very behavior he exemplifies. Remember what he said at the beginning?

[CLIP: main_transcript.mp4 | 01:29 - 00:01:46 (REPLAY)]\
**DESTINY:** "...they will eject all of their unhinged shit into some public forum."

**NARRATOR:**\
Who is really ejecting unhinged shit into a public forum? The man spending an hour dissecting his opponent's relationship, pathologizing his critics as a disease, and projecting his own manipulative behavior onto others.

This isn't about Jstlk or Chaeiry. This is about Destiny. He is facing serious consequences for his alleged actions, and his response is to burn everything around him to create a diversion. He is not a victim. He is a defendant, and this is the desperate act of a man who knows the walls are closing in.
